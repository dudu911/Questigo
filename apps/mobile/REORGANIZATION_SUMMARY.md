# Mobile App Reorganization Summary

## ✅ Completed Reorganization

Successfully reorganized the `apps/mobile/` directory with a proper `src/` folder structure following React Native best practices.

### What Was Changed

1. **Created organized folder structure:**

   ```
   src/
   ├── components/          # Reusable UI components
   ├── constants/          # App constants and data
   ├── hooks/              # Custom React hooks
   ├── screens/            # Screen components
   ├── types/              # TypeScript declarations (moved)
   ├── utils/              # Utility functions
   └── index.ts            # Central export file
   ```

2. **Refactored App.tsx:**
   - Simplified main App component to just render HomeScreen
   - Moved all logic into organized, focused components

3. **Extracted reusable components:**
   - `QuestCard.tsx` - Individual quest display component with enhanced styling
   - `HomeScreen.tsx` - Main screen component with clean separation of concerns

4. **Created utility functions:**
   - `questUtils.ts` - Dynamic color functions for categories and difficulty levels
   - Better code organization and reusability

5. **Implemented custom hooks:**
   - `useQuestProgress.ts` - Stateful logic for managing quest progress
   - Demonstrates React hooks best practices

6. **Moved sample data to constants:**
   - `sampleData.ts` - Centralized sample quest data and initial state
   - Easier to maintain and modify test data

7. **Updated TypeScript configuration:**
   - Added path aliases support (`~/*` maps to `src/*`)
   - Enhanced import organization capabilities

### Benefits Achieved

- **Better Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated folders
- **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files that are easier to understand
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Components and hooks can be easily reused
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript checks pass successfully
- **Scalability**: Structure supports future growth with additional features
- **Best Practices**: Follows React Native and React development standards

### Verified Working

- ✅ Mobile app builds successfully (`pnpm --filter mobile build`)
- ✅ All type checks pass (`pnpm type-check`)
- ✅ Maintains existing functionality with improved code quality
- ✅ Enhanced visual styling with dynamic colors
- ✅ Proper import/export structure

The mobile app now has a professional, scalable folder structure that will support future development while maintaining all existing functionality.
